Welcome to my Coding Interview Challenges repository! This repository serves as a collection of coding challenges that I have completed on various platforms such as Hackerrank and AlgoExpert. The goal is to continuously improve my coding skills, learn new algorithms, and prepare for upcoming interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by platform, with each platform having its own dedicated folder. Inside each folder, you will find solutions to the challenges I have attempted, along with any accompanying files or notes.

- **[Hackerrank](hackerrank):** Solutions to challenges from Hackerrank.
- **[AlgoExpert](algoexpert):** Solutions to challenges from AlgoExpert.

Feel free to explore the folders, review the solutions, and provide feedback or suggestions. The repository is a work in progress, and I will be regularly updating it with new challenges and solutions.

## Usage

If you're also preparing for coding interviews or simply interested in exploring different coding challenges, you can clone this repository and use it as a resource to practice and learn. Each solution is accompanied by comments and explanations to help you understand the thought process behind the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/math-ferreira/coding-interview-challenges.git
